# 🌀 Meet Froby!

Welcome to the **official Froby website** – home of the world's goofiest ice cream cone with legs, eyes, and a whole lot of drippy attitude. 🍦

## 🎨 Who is Froby?

**Froby** is not your average frozen treat. Born from a mix of strawberry chaos and chocolate confusion, Froby is a lovable, slightly unhinged cartoon character made of:

- A crunchy cone body 🍯  
- Two big scoops for eyes (strawberry & chocolate) 👁️  
- Sticky limbs drawn with pure doodle energy ✍️  
- An eternal ice cream drip that refuses to fall 🫠  

He's cute. He's weird. He's got one job: **make your day sillier.**
